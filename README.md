# airflow-server

This is a testing ground for spinning up an airflow server. I used it to monitor Reddit comments and stream comment scores to client applications. This was right around the great Reddit API debacle so I lost interest. Nevertheless, this repo has some useful Airflow patterns worth taking a look at.

NOTE: if you try and run this on a regular macbook, you'll likely encounter errors since by default airflow wants several GB of RAM (4+, ideally closer to 8). As a result, you'll probably want to run this in the cloud on its own instance.
