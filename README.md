# airflow-server
This is a testing ground for spinning up an airflow server.

NOTE: if you try and run this on a regular macbook, you'll likely encounter errors since by default airflow wants several GB of RAM (4+, ideally closer to 8). As a result, you'll probably want to run this in the cloud on its own instance.
